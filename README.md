# Car-Share-Analysis
Logistic regression examining the variables associated with car share membership in Puget Sound.

This analysis uses data from the Puget Sound Regional Council's Household Travel Survey from 2019: https://www.psrc.org/household-travel-survey-program. The survey of 6,000 households reports travel behavior, attitudes, and preferences on a trip, household, vehicle, and person-level basis. 

The analysis finds that higher-income household are more likely to be car share members, but the effect of income is strongest if they live in a designated "urban village" of Seattle, particularly the densest urban neighborhoods. For households in suburban areas, car share rates are low regardless of income.
